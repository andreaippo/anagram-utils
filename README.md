# anagram-utils

## Overview

This package provides two utility features related to anagrams.

> An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all 
> the original letters exactly once. For example, the word anagram itself can be rearranged into the nonsense 
> phrase "nag a ram".
> 
> [..]
> 
> The original word or phrase is known as the subject of the anagram.

### Two-way check

This feature verifies if two texts provided are anagrams of each other.

### History-based check

This feature accepts an input text, and returns all the known anagrams for such input, by considering exclusively 
the inputs that have previously been supplied to the Two-way check feature.
